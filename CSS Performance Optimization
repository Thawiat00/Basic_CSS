Optimizing CSS
Optimizing CSS makes your website load faster and run more smoothly; which also results in a better user experience.

Here are some tips for optimizing CSS:

1. Use Simple Selectors
Use simple selectors when possible. Complex selectors increase the parsing time.

Bad Example
body #navlist ul li a.button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}
Better Example
.button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}
2. Avoid Universal Selector for Styling
Avoid the universal selector (*) when not strictly necessary. The universal selector (*) affects every element and can slow down page rendering.

 Example
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 16px;
}
3. Avoid Inline Styles
Avoid inline styles when not necessary. Inline styles make your HTML heavier and are harder to manage.

Bad Example
<div style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Hello</div>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">Test</p>
REMOVE ADS

4. Avoid @import
Avoid using @import for loading external CSS, as it delays stylesheet loading.

Add external CSS with the <link> tag in the head section, so it loads before the page is rendered.

Example
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
5. Use Shorthand Properties
Use shorthand properties when possible. It saves space and is faster to parse.

Example
/* Long version */
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 20px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: 20px;

/* Shorthand version */
margin: 10px 20px;
6. Cut Down Unnecessary Animations
A high number of animations and large animations require more processing power to handle, which degrades performance. So, remove unnecessary animations.

7. Use Properties that Not Cause Repaint of Animations
Animation performance relies also on what properties you are animating.

Some properties (like width, height, left, top), trigger a layout recalculation when animated, and should be avoided.

If possible, use animation properties that do not cause repaint, like transforms, opacity and filter.

8. Combine and Minify CSS
Use one CSS file when possible, and remove spaces and comments to reduce file size.

You can use tools like:

CSS Minifier
PostCSS
Online compressors
9. Cache Your CSS
Make sure your CSS file is cached by the browser by giving it a long expiration time in your server settings. This reduces how often users need to re-load it.
